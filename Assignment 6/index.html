              Ryan Rodney Reynolds was born on October 23, 1976, in Vancouver,
              British Columbia. He is the youngest of four sons. His father,
              James Chester Reynolds, was a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman
              before retiring from the force and going to work as a foods
              wholesaler.His mother, Tamara Lee (née Stewart) worked
              in retail sales. Reynolds has two brothers who work in law
              enforcement in British Columbia, one of whom followed his father
              into the RCMP. His paternal grandfather, Chester Reynolds,
              was a farmer who represented Stettler in the Legislative Assembly
              of Alberta from 1940 to 1944. Reynolds has Irish and Scottish
              ancestry, and was raised in the Roman Catholic Church in
              Vancouver's Kitsilano neighbourhood. He has been involved
              in acting since age thirteen. He graduated from Kitsilano
              Secondary School in 1994, which he attended with actor Joshua
              Jackson. Reynolds played small roles in a number of television
              series, but became discouraged and quit acting at age 19 to enroll
              at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. A few months later he ran into
              fellow actor Chris William Martin, who convinced him to try again
              and move with him to Los Angeles.

              Reynolds first met Blake Lively in early 2010 while filming Green
              Lantern, in which they co-starred. They began dating in
              October 2011 and married on September 9, 2012, at Boone Hall
              Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. In the wake of
              civil rights protests in 2020, Reynolds publicly apologized and
              expressed deep regret for using that venue due to its association
              with slavery; he and Lively renewed their vows at home in New
              York. The couple have three daughters: James, born December
              2014,Inez, born September 2016,[94][95] and Betty in
              2019.

                Although he had performed primarily in comedies, Reynolds
                underwent intense physical training to play an action role as
                the character of Hannibal King in the 2004 film Blade:
                Trinity.[18] The same year, he made a cameo appearance in Harold
                & Kumar Go to White Castle as a nurse. Reynolds played George
                Lutz in the 2005 remake of the 1979 horror film The Amityville

                In 2016, Reynolds found critical and commercial success with
                Deadpool, a film that had been in development as early as 2000.
                After portraying Wade Wilson / Weapon XI, without the name
                Deadpool, in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he became heavily
                involved in the development of a Deadpool film. Deadpool
                featured a reboot of the character, ignoring the events of X-Men
                Origins: Wolverine, and establishing a new backstory for the
                character that was closer to the Marvel Comics source material.
                The film takes place within the larger X-Men film universe,
                being made possible by the reset timeline in X-Men: Days of
                Future Past. Deadpool made several box-office records,
                including: a worldwide opening of $264.9 million from 62
                markets, which is the biggest of 2016, the biggest for an
                R-rated film, and the second biggest for Fox, only behind Star
                Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith ($303.9
                million).[31][32] It also recorded the biggest IMAX 2D worldwide
                opening of all time with $27.4 million from 606 IMAX theatres,
                eclipsing The Dark Knight Rises ($23.8 million).[33][34] The
                film's financial and critical success led the studio to move
                forward with a sequel.

                Also in 2016, Reynolds had a supporting role in the Ariel

                Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson in the science fiction thriller
                Life in 2017, which reunited him with Safe House director Daniel
                Espinosa.[37] Reynolds began filming Deadpool 2 in June 2017.
                The film opened on May 18, 2018.[38][39] In May 2019, he starred
                as the titular character in Pokémon Detective Pikachu, a live

                CGI detective Pikachu.[40] In January 2019, Reynolds was named
                the face of Armani Code leading with a campaign for their Absolu
                scent.[41] Also that year, he starred in the Netflix action
                thriller film 6 Underground, directed by Michael Bay.[42] The
                film was released on December 13.[43] Reynolds is an executive
                producer of ABC's game show, Don't, which premiered on June 11,
                2020.[44][45] In January 2019, it was announced that he would

            In January 2018, Reynolds started the production company Maximum
            Effort and signed a three-year first-look deal with Fox. Maximum
            Effort is in development on a live-action adaptation of the board
            game Clue, to be penned by Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul

            representatives for the pair announced they had mutually decided to
            end their engagement.[79] Morissette said her album Flavors of
